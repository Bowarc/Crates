### Here are some Rust crates I've developed for different tasks in my projects. Each one is made to simplify specific functionalities.


- [**Enum Variant Name**](enum_variant_name/README.md): Provides a convenient derive macro to retrieve the variant name of an enum in Rust.

- [**Logger**](logger/README.md): Straightforward wrapper around the [fern](https://docs.rs/fern) logger, simplifying logging configuration and setup.

- [**Mem**](mem/README.md): Nothing really interesting here.

- [**Networking**](networking/README.md): Simplifies TCP connections with socket-style wrapper around `std::net::TcpStream` and a proxy mechanism that offers basic stats calculation for round-trip time and bytes exchanged.

- [**Random**](random/README.md): Essential tools for randomization.

- [**Threading**](threading/README.md): Bundle of `std::sync::mpsc::Sender` and `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver` with some added methods.

- [**Time**](time/README.md): Simple delay, stopwatch, function timing and time formatting.


Please check each crate's readme for more detailed information on their usage.
